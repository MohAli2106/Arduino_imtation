# Arduino Simulator in Rust

This project is a basic simulation of an Arduino microcontroller written in Rust. It mimics Arduino's core functionality, including digital and analog pin control.

## Features
- Simulates **digital pin modes** (INPUT, OUTPUT).
- Supports **digital read/write** (HIGH, LOW).
- Simulates **analog read/write** (0-1023 values).
